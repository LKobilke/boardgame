[["index.html", "Data journalism General information on the course What can I learn from this tutorial? What can I do if I have a question? What can I do if I have problems with my R code?", " Data journalism Lara Kobilke, IfKW, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München 2022-11-23 General information on the course This online tutorial will accompany the seminar “Data Journalism”, an M.A. Seminar at the IfKW (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, SS2022). The course takes place in Oettingenstraße 67, Room 151 (Wednesday 14:15-15.45 pm). You can access all necessary information on the seminar’s syllabus, important dates and assignments via Moodle, “2023 WiSe Kobilke - Datenjournalismus” (PW: Datenjournalismus22). There, additional resources (e.g. Powerpoint slides, book resources, etc.) are uploaded to the material folders of the respective week. What can I learn from this tutorial? After completing the entire tutorial, you will have acquired two important skills: Know how to use R and RStudio to complete your data management. Know how to use R and RStudio to successfully complete your own data journalistic projects (analysis + visualization). If time allows, know how to use R and RStudio to host your project on a shiny app or an external website (e.g., your own blog). In the first part of this seminar, we will work through this tutorial and solve exercises together. The tutorial is designed to provide the R skills that you need to put data journalistic project into real-world practice. In the second part of the seminar, you will work on your own project (“learning-by-doing”). Each tutorial consists of: an introduction to new functions/analysis methods in R, including corresponding R code main take-aways that you should remember information on additional tutorials / sources exercises to practice your new skills (you’ll often work through these with your peers) What can I do if I have a question? Questions are welcome! It’s natural to have a lot of questions because you’ll be learning a lot of new stuff. Please do ask if you don’t understand something in this tutorial, have questions concerning exercises, or simply need to talk through some of the new stuff. It’s quite natural to get lost at times when learning a new programming language. Don’t worry; it’s extremely probable that everyone else is experiencing the same thing. Therefore, it’s key that you ask questions: In our live sessions: Wednesday, 14:15-15:45. In the Moodle forum: Please, post all your questions to the Moodle forum. Every participant will be able to see your questions, submit replies, and view my responses. As a result, everyone will have access to the same information. To stay updated about current debates, I recommend that you turn on alerts about new entries in the forum. Email: Send me an email at lara.kobilke@ifkw.lmu.de if you have any private questions that you don’t want to address in front of the rest of the class. What can I do if I have problems with my R code? Besides asking a question during the seminar (see What can I do if I have a question?), there are some great places to have a look at when you encounter problems. To give you a head start, here’s a quick rundown of the three best places to look if you have a problem with your code: R’s integrated help function: Use the ?-function whenever possible. Let’s assume you struggle with creating a histogram for your data (hist function in R). You can open the R documentation of the hist function in R by writing: ?hist Preview of ?hist in R: Search engines: Like Bing or Google. Yup, programmers and data scientists google all the time! Nobody knows all the code and errors by heart. Often you can find perfect answers to your questions on Stackoverflow, StatsExchange, or Rseek because other people had exactly the same problems. And more importantly, the communities on these websites are very friendly and helpful. Packages’ reference manuals: Finally, problems with R packages (we’ll get to packages later, see: Packages) can often be solved by looking at their reference manuals (an overview document containing all of a package’s functions). For example, you can learn more about dplyr (a data management package that we are going to use later in this tutorial) by visiting its reference manual on a website called “CRAN”: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf. That is all there is to it. Let’s begin with our first tutorial: Tutorial: Installing &amp; Understanding R/R Studio "],["tutorial-installing-understanding-rr-studio.html", " 1 Tutorial: Installing &amp; Understanding R/R Studio 1.1 Installing R 1.2 Installing R Studio 1.3 Updating R and R Studio 1.4 How does R work? 1.5 Why should I use R? 1.6 How does R Studio work? 1.7 Packages 1.8 Take-Aways 1.9 Additional tutorials", " 1 Tutorial: Installing &amp; Understanding R/R Studio After working through Tutorial 1, you’ll… know how to install R and R Studio know how to update R and R Studio understand the layout of R Studio 1.1 Installing R R is the programming language we’ll use to import, edit, and analyze data. When you are ready to install R, use Cran to install the newest version of R (version 4.2.1, realeased 2022-06-23, called “Funny-Looking Kid”). You’ll have to specify your operation system to download the right version: Installer for Windows Installer for macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and higher Installer for macOS 11 (Big Sur) and higher Mac Users: Please read the documentation of the installers on this site. You might need to install other dependencies to make R work. 1.2 Installing R Studio Next, install R Studio. R Studio is a desktop application with a graphical interface that facilitates programming with R. The newest version of R Studio (2022.07.2+576) can be downloaded via this Link. 1.3 Updating R and R Studio If you have already installed R and RStudio (for example, because you already needed it for a previous seminar), please update your version to the latest version. This way, we’ll all know that our versions are compatible. 1.3.1 On Windows Updating on Windows is tricky. Therefore, you can use a package called installr, which helps you manage your update. First, install the installr package if you don’t have it. Use the following code to do that: # installing/loading the package: if(!require(installr)) { install.packages(&quot;installr&quot;); require(installr) } #load / install+load installr After you have run the above code, let’s start the updating process of your R installation by using the updateR() function. It will check for newer versions, and if one is available, will guide you through the decisions you’d need to make: # using the package: updateR() Finally, update R Studio. Updating RStudio is easy, just open RStudio and go to Help &gt; Check for Updates to install a newer version. 1.3.2 On MAC Go to CRAN and install the newer package installer. After that update R Studio. Updating RStudio is easy, just open RStudio and go to Help &gt; Check for Updates to install a newer version. 1.4 How does R work? R is an object- and function-oriented programming language. Chambers (2014, p. 4) explains “object- and function-oriented” like this: Everything that exists is an object. Everything that happens is a function call. IN R, you will assign values (for instance, single numbers/letters, several numbers/letters, or whole data files) to objects in R to work with them. For example, this command will assign the letters “hello” to an object caled word by using the assign operator &lt;- (a function used to assign values to objects): word &lt;- &quot;hello&quot; The type of each object will dictate what sorts of computations you may be done with this object. The object word, for example, is distinguished by the fact that it is made up of characters (i.e., it is a word) - which may make it impossible to compute the object’s mean value, for example (which is possible only for objects consisting of numerical data). 1.5 Why should I use R? There are several reasons why I’m an advocate of R (or similar programming languages such as Python) over programs such as SPSS. R is free. Other than most other (statistical) programs, you do not need to buy it (or rely on an university license, that is likely to run out once you leave your department). R is an open source program. Other than most other programs, the source code - i.e., the basis of the program - is freely available. So are the hundred of packages (we’ll get to those later – these are basically additional functions you may need for more specific analyses) on CRAN that you can use to extend R’s base functions. R offers you flexibility. You can work with almost any type of data and rely on a large (!) set of functions to import, edit, or analyze such data. And if the function you need to do so hasn’t been implemented (or simply does not exist yet), you can write it yourself! Learning R increases your chances on the job market. For many jobs (academia, market research, data science, data journalism), applicants should know at least one programming language. 1.6 How does R Studio work? As mentioned before, R Studio is a graphical interface which facilitates programming with R. It contains up to four main windows, which allow for different things: Writing your own code (Window 1: Source). Important: When first installing R/R Studio and opening R Studio, you may not see this window right away. In this case, simply open it by clicking on File/New File/R Script. Executing your own code (Window 2: Console) Inspecting objects (Window 3: Environment) Visualizing data, searching for help, updating packages etc. (Window 4: Files/Plots/Packages etc.) Image: Four main windows in R Please note that the specific set-up of your R Studio may look different (the order of windows may vary and so may the windows’ names). I have made the experience that having these four windows open works best for me. This may be different for you. If you want to modify the appearance of your R Studio, simply choose “Tools/Global Options/Pane Layout”. Image: Changing the Layout 1.6.1 Source: Writing your own code Using the window “Source”, you’ll write your own code to execute whichever task you want R to fulfill. 1.6.1.1 Writing Code Let’s start with an easy example: Assume you simply want R to print the word “hello”. In this case, you would first write a simple command that assigns the word “hello” to an object called word. The assigment of values to named objects is done via either the operator “&lt;-” or the operator “=”. The left side of that command contains the object that should be created; its right side the values that should be assigned to this object. In short, this command tells R to assign the world “hello” to an object called word. word &lt;- &quot;hello&quot; Image: “Source” 1.6.1.2 Annotating Code Another helpful aspect of R is that you can comment your own code. Oftentimes, this is very helpful for understanding your code later (if you write several hundred lines of codes, you may not remember their exact meaning months later). Comments or notes can be made via hashtags #. Anything following a hashtag will not be considered code by R but be ignored instead. word &lt;- &quot;hello&quot; #this line of code assigns the word &quot;hello&quot; to an object called word 1.6.1.3 Executing Code We now want to execute our code. Doing so is simple: Mark the parts of the code you want to run (for instance, single rows of code or blocks of code across several rows) Either press Run (see upper right side of the same window) or press Ctrl + Enter (On Mac OS X, hold the command key and press return instead). R should now execute exactly those lines of codes that you marked (hereby creating the object word). If you haven’t marked any specific code, all lines of code will be executed. Image: Executing Code 1.6.1.4 Saving Code A great feature of R is that it makes analyses easily reproducible - given that you save your code. When reopening R Studio and you script, you can simply “rerun” the code with one click and your analysis will be reproduced. To save code, you have two options: Choose the menu option File/Save as. Important: Code needs to be saved with the ending “.R”. Chose the Save-button in the source window and save your code in the correct format, for instance as “MyCode.R” (some advice: try to avoid numbers or dates as file names because this can break the saving process). Image: Saving code 1.6.2 Console: Printing results Results of executing code are printed in a second window called “Console”, which includes the code you ran and the object you may have called when doing so. Previously, we defined an object called word, which consists of the single word “hello”. Thus, R prints our code as well as objects called when running this code (here, the object word) in the console. word &lt;- &quot;hello&quot; word ## [1] &quot;hello&quot; Image: Window “Console” 1.6.3 Environment: Overview of objects The third window is called “Environment”1. This windows displays all the objects currently existing - in our case, only the object “word”. As soon as you start creating more objects, this environment will fill up. If you’re an SPSS user, this window is very similar to what is called the Datenansicht / Data overview in SPSS. However, the R version of this is much more flexible, given that our environment can contain several data sets, for example, at the same time. Image: Window “Environment” It is important to know that we can visually inspect any object using the View() command (with a new tab then opening in the “Source” window). This isn’t super helpful right now - but if you work with bigger data sets with several observations/variables later on, it is often useful to inspect data visually. View(word) Image: Window “View” 1.6.4 Plots/Help/Packages: Do everything else Lastly, the standard R Studio interface contains a fourth window (if you opted for this layout). In my case, the window contains several sub-sections called “Files”, “Plots”, or “Packages” among others. You’ll understand their specific functions later - the window can, for instance, be used to plot/visualize results or see which packages are currently loaded. Image: Window “Files/Plots/Packages” 1.7 Packages While Base R, i.e., the standard version of R, already includes many helpful functions, you may at times need other, additional functions. For instance, if we want to perform text analysis in R we’ll need to use specific packages including additional functions. Packages are collections of topic-specific functions that extend the functions implemented in Base R. In the spirit of “open science”, anyone can write and publish these additional functions and related packages and anyone can also access the code used to do so. You’ll find a list of all of R packages here. In this seminar, we’ll for instance use packages like dplyr for advanced data management. 1.7.1 Installing packages To use a package, you have to install it first. Let’s say you’re interested in using the package dplyr. Using the command install.packages(), you can install the package on your computer. You’ll have to give the function the name of the package you are interested in installing. install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Now the package has been installed on your computer and is accessible locally. We only have to use install.packages() for any package once. Afterwards, the only thing you’ll have to do after open R is to activate the already installed package - which we’ll learn next. 1.7.2 Activating packages Before we are able to use a package, we need to activate it in each session. Thus, you should not only define a working directory at the beginning of each session but also activate the packages you want to use via the library()_ command. Again, you’ll have to give R the name of the package you want to activate: library(dplyr) You can also use the name of the package followed by two colons :: to activate a package directly before calling one of its functions. For instance, I do not need use to activate the dplyr package (by using the library() function) to use the function summarize() if I use the following code: dplyr::summarize() 1.7.3 Getting information about packages The package is installed and activated - but how can we use it? To get an overview of functions included in a given package, you can consult its corresponding “reference manual” (overview document containing all of a package’s functions) or, if available, its “vignette” (tutorials on how to use selected functions for the corresponding package) provided by a package’s author on a website called “CRAN”. The easiest way to finding these manuals/vignettes is Google: Simply google CRAN dplyr, for instance, and you’ll be guided to the following website: Image: Cran Overview dplyr package The first paragraph (circled in red) gives you an overview of aspects for which this package may be useful. The second red-circled area links to the reference manual and the vignette. You can, for instance, check out the reference manual to get an idea of the many functions the dplyr package contains. 1.8 Take-Aways Window “Source”: used to write/execute code in R Window “Console”: used to return results of executed code Window “Environment”: used to inspect objects on which to use functions Window “Files/Plots/Packages etc.”: used for additional functions, for instance visualizations/searching for help/activating or updating packages 1.9 Additional tutorials You still have questions? The following tutorials &amp; papers can help you with that: YaRrr! The Pirate’s Guide to R by N.D.Phillips, Tutorial 2 Computational Methods in der politischen Kommunikationsforschung by J. Unkel, Tutorial 1 SICSS Boot Camp by C. Bail, Video 1 wegweisR by M. Haim, Video 1 R Cookbook by Long et al., Tutorial 1 Now that you know the layout of R, we can get started with some real action: Tutorial: Using R as a calculator again, this only applies for the way I set up my R Studio. You can change this via “Tools/Global Options/Pane Layout”↩︎ "],["tutorial-using-r-as-a-calculator.html", " 2 Tutorial: Using R as a calculator 2.1 Using variables for calculation 2.2 Using vectors for calculation 2.3 Selecting values from a vector 2.4 Take-Aways 2.5 Additional tutorials", " 2 Tutorial: Using R as a calculator After working through Tutorial 2, you’ll… be able to work with mathematical operators in R be able to use mathematical operators on variables and vectors subset values from vectors One of the first things everyone learns in R is to use R as a calculator. You have access to many mathematical operators in R (e.g. +, -, *, /, ^). Let’s try some of them. Addition: 5+7 ## [1] 12 Subtraction: 12-7 ## [1] 5 Exponentiation: 3^3 ## [1] 27 2.1 Using variables for calculation You can also assign numbers to variables with the assign operator “&lt;-”. We have already talked about assigning word or numbers to variables in the chapter Writing Code. Please remember that a variable name in R can include numeric and alphabets along with special characters like dot (.) and underline (_).’ Therefore, these are good options to name your variables: my_1st_number &lt;- 3 my.1st.numer &lt;- 3 Do !not! use these variable names because they will cause errors and throw warning messages. I have therefore put the code as annotation to avoid the warning messages (with #): # _number &lt;- 3 # .number &lt;- 3 # my-1st-number &lt;- 3 You can use variables in your calculations by assigning the numbers to variables (i.e. store the numerical value in the variable).’ five &lt;- 5 seven &lt;- 7 twelve &lt;- five + seven # here you add the two variables in which the numbers are stored. The result of the addition is stored in the variable &quot;twelve&quot; twelve # now you have to retrieve the content of the variable, so that the result is printed to the console ## [1] 12 The names of the variables are freely selectable. For example, you can also proceed like this: three &lt;- 5 three # print the content of the variable to the console ## [1] 5 2.2 Using vectors for calculation You can also store more than one number in a variable. We call this process “creating vectors” because variables that contain more than one number are called “vectors” in R (we’ll get to vectors in [Tutorial: Objects &amp; structures in R]). Vectors are created using the combine function c() in R. twelve &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12) twelve # print the content of the variable to the console ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Again, the variable name is chosen arbitrarily. You can also do this: twelve &lt;- c(4,10,15,21,33) twelve # print the content of the variable to the console ## [1] 4 10 15 21 33 You can use mathematical operations on vectors (e.g., +, -, * and /). Let’s create two vectors “weight” and “height” that contain the weight and height measures of 6 individuals. For example, the first individual weighs 60 kg and is 1.75 m tall: weight &lt;- c(60, 72, 57, 90, 95, 72) height &lt;- c(1.75, 1.80, 1.65, 1.90, 1.74, 1.91) Now we can calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the BMI formula: BMI &lt;- weight/height^2 BMI # print the content of the BMI variable to the console ## [1] 19.59184 22.22222 20.93664 24.93075 31.37799 19.73630 Now we know that the first person has a BMI of 19.59, which is within the range of normality (18.5 and 24.9). 2.3 Selecting values from a vector We still see the BMI of all the other five people, i.e. the entire vector. How can we select only the first person? You can select values from a vector by using square brackets [ ] and enter the number of the entry that you want to print to your console. BMI[1] ## [1] 19.59184 Again, you can see that the first person has a BMI of 19.59. You could also decide to look at all values except the first one: BMI[-1] ## [1] 22.22222 20.93664 24.93075 31.37799 19.73630 You can even use the [ ] selector on vectors that consist of words instead of numbers. These vectors are called “character vectors”, while vectors that contain numbers are called “numeric vectors”. Let’s create a character vector that contains the BMIs of the six individuals as words. We’ll need to put quotation marks around your entries so that R knows that those values are words not numbers. BMI_word &lt;- c(&quot;nineteen&quot;, &quot;twenty-two&quot;, &quot;twenty&quot;, &quot;twenty-four&quot;, &quot;thirty-one&quot;, &quot;nineteen&quot;) BMI_word ## [1] &quot;nineteen&quot; &quot;twenty-two&quot; &quot;twenty&quot; &quot;twenty-four&quot; &quot;thirty-one&quot; ## [6] &quot;nineteen&quot; We’ll now select only the first value of of this BMI_word character vector: BMI_word[1] ## [1] &quot;nineteen&quot; If you want to select multiple values, you can index them. Let’s select the BMI of the third, fourth and fifth individual: BMI_word[3:5] ## [1] &quot;twenty&quot; &quot;twenty-four&quot; &quot;thirty-one&quot; 2.4 Take-Aways Mathematical operators: use +, -, *, /, ^ Use case: use these operators on numbers, variables, and vectors Create vectors: use the combine function c() Select values from vectors: use square brackets [ ] 2.5 Additional tutorials You still have questions? The following online guides can help you with that: Using R as a Calculator R Vector "],["tutorial-working-with-data-files.html", " 3 Tutorial: Working with data (files) 3.1 Defining your working directory 3.2 Import data from your working directory 3.3 Subsetting variables / columns in data frames 3.4 Subsetting observations / rows in data frames 3.5 Subsetting values / cells in data frames 3.6 Subsetting data with conditions 3.7 Take-Aways 3.8 Additional tutorials", " 3 Tutorial: Working with data (files) After working through Tutorial 3, you’ll… understand how to import data know how to select variables in data frames know how to access values in data frames 3.1 Defining your working directory In most cases, you do not want to manually enter all your values into R and combine them with the “c()” function. Instead, you want to import data files that you already have on your drive/personal computer. The first step to importing your data into R is to define your working directory. Your working directory is the folder from which data can be imported into R or to which you can export and save data created with R. Create a folder that you want to use as your working directory for this tutorial (or use an existing one, that also works). For example, I’ve created a folder called “IPR” (short for In Public Repository). Go to that folder and copy the path to it: Image: Working Directory on Windows Image: Copy Working Directory on Windows On Mac, you go to your folder and right click on it. An options menu opens and you can copy the folder path: Image: Copy Working Directory on MAC Now you know where this working directory is located - but R should know, too! Telling R from which folder to import data or where to export data to is also called setting your working directory. We call a function called setwd() (you guessed right: short for “setting your working directory”) which allows us to do exactly that. Important: The way this working directory is set differs between Windows- and Mac-Operating Systems. Windows: The dashes need to be pointing towards the right direction (if you simply copy the path to the folder, you may need to replace these signs “\\” with “/”) setwd(&quot;C:/Users/LaraK/Documents/IPR&quot;) Mac: You may need to add a “/” at the beginning like so: setwd(&quot;/Users/LaraK/Documents/IPR&quot;) If you have forgotten where you set your working directory, you can also ask R about the path of your current working directory with getwd(): getwd() ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/LaraK/Documents/IPR&quot; 3.1.1 Optional: Setting the working directory on a remote desktop The LMU Munich provides you with remote desktop access to the PCs in the local CIP-Pools. If you want to use your remote desktop to run R &amp; RStudio, you can follow this link to log into the remote desktop. This is a great fix if – for whatever reason – you can’t get R(Studio) installed on your machine and need a quick solution! Once you have logged in to the remote desktop, you can open RStudio and set the working directory (and import data) just like it is described in this tutorial (see next image). Image: Working Directory (&amp; Data Import) on a Remote Desktop The drawback: Since Windows does not allow RStudio to save script files without permission (and the IfKW for some reason has not given the permission), you can’t save script files on the remote desktop. You can solve this with a workaround: Paste your script into a text file before closing RStuio. E.g., WordPad is pre-installed. Save this file as .R. When you want to load your script in RStudio, right click on the .R file and choose “open with RStudio”. Image: Saving a Script File on a Remote Desktop 3.2 Import data from your working directory After setting the working directory, you need to transfer the data file that you want to work with to that folder (here: the “IPR” folder). Download the “data_tutorial3.csv” from Moodle, i.e., the 2. November material folder. The data set consists of data that is completely made up - a survey with 20 fictional students in a fictional seminar. We only use this data here so you can understand differences between types of data and types of objects. The data file data_tutorial3.csv is structured as follows: Each row contains the answer for a single student. Each column contains all values given by students for a single variable. The variables included here are: name: the name of each student age: the age of each student (in years) date: the date on which each student was surveyed (in YYYY-MM-DD) outlet: the type of media outlet each student’s mainly uses to get information outlet_use: the time each student uses this media outlet daily (in hours) outlet_trust: how much each student trusts this media outlet (from 1 = not at all to 5 = very much) We’ll read in the file with read.csv(). Here, we specify where to find the data file with the file path in quotation marks, but you don’t need to specify that path if you have already set it as your working directory. In addition, we provide an argument to let R know that the first row contains variable names with the argument header = TRUE. In the end, we assign our data file to a source object that we call survey. The data is now stored in this object. While read.csv() reads in comma-separated values, read.csv2() reads in values that are separated by semicolons. survey &lt;- read.csv2(&quot;data_tutorial3.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) survey ## X.2 X.1 X name age date outlet outlet_use outlet_trust ## 1 1 1 1 Alexandra 20 2021-09-09 TV 2 5 ## 2 2 2 2 Alex 25 2021-09-08 Online 3 5 ## 3 3 3 3 Maximilian 29 2021-09-09 Zeitung 4 1 ## 4 4 4 4 Moritz 22 2021-09-06 TV 2 2 ## 5 5 5 5 Vanessa 25 2021-09-07 Online 1 3 ## 6 6 6 6 Andrea 26 2021-09-09 Online 3 4 ## 7 7 7 7 Fabienne 26 2021-09-09 TV 3 2 ## 8 8 8 8 Fabio 27 2021-09-09 Online 0 1 ## 9 9 9 9 Magdalena 8 2021-09-08 Online 1 4 ## 10 10 10 10 Tim 26 2021-09-07 TV NA 2 ## 11 11 11 11 Alex 27 2021-09-09 Online NA 2 ## 12 12 12 12 Tobias 26 2021-09-07 Online 2 2 ## 13 13 13 13 Michael 25 2021-09-09 Online 3 2 ## 14 14 14 14 Sabrina 27 2021-09-08 Online 1 2 ## 15 15 15 15 Valentin 29 2021-09-09 TV 1 5 ## 16 16 16 16 Tristan 26 2021-09-09 TV 2 5 ## 17 17 17 17 Martin 21 2021-09-09 Online 1 2 ## 18 18 18 18 Anna 23 2021-09-08 TV 3 3 ## 19 19 19 19 Andreas 24 2021-09-09 TV 2 5 ## 20 20 20 20 Florian 26 2021-09-09 Online 1 5 3.3 Subsetting variables / columns in data frames In Tutorial: Using R as a calculator your variables where “floating” in your workspace / environment. They were not kept in a container, so you could call them by simply writing their name in the console. When you import data files to R, all variables in that data set a stored into a “container”, i.e. your source object. These containers for variables are called data frame in R. Variables that are part of a data frame can be accessed by their name, but we need to specify the data frame AND the variable name and combine them with the access operator: $. This takes the form of: dataframe$variablename # the first part is the container name, i.e. data frame # this is followed by the access operator $ # finally, you call the variable by name For instance, we could retrieve the variable “name” in our survey data frame by simply using its variable name: We specify the object we want to access, the data frame survey and then retrieve the column name via the operator $: survey$name ## [1] &quot;Alexandra&quot; &quot;Alex&quot; &quot;Maximilian&quot; &quot;Moritz&quot; &quot;Vanessa&quot; ## [6] &quot;Andrea&quot; &quot;Fabienne&quot; &quot;Fabio&quot; &quot;Magdalena&quot; &quot;Tim&quot; ## [11] &quot;Alex&quot; &quot;Tobias&quot; &quot;Michael&quot; &quot;Sabrina&quot; &quot;Valentin&quot; ## [16] &quot;Tristan&quot; &quot;Martin&quot; &quot;Anna&quot; &quot;Andreas&quot; &quot;Florian&quot; You know that the name variable is the fourth column of you data frame. Therefore, you can also access this column / variable by calling it by its index number (column index, here: 4). Just like you’ve learned in Tutorial: Using R as a calculator, you can access sub-elements of a greater object with square brackets [ ]: survey[4] ## name ## 1 Alexandra ## 2 Alex ## 3 Maximilian ## 4 Moritz ## 5 Vanessa ## 6 Andrea ## 7 Fabienne ## 8 Fabio ## 9 Magdalena ## 10 Tim ## 11 Alex ## 12 Tobias ## 13 Michael ## 14 Sabrina ## 15 Valentin ## 16 Tristan ## 17 Martin ## 18 Anna ## 19 Andreas ## 20 Florian Note: While the first command gives you the names as a vector, the second one gives you the name as a data frame object with only one column. This keeps the column header “name” intact. However, if you want to retrieve a vector using the column index, you need to provide two indices: one for the row that you want to select, followed by a comma, and one for the column. Since we want to select all rows, but only column No. 4, we need leave the row No. blank: survey[,4] # column index = 4 ## [1] &quot;Alexandra&quot; &quot;Alex&quot; &quot;Maximilian&quot; &quot;Moritz&quot; &quot;Vanessa&quot; ## [6] &quot;Andrea&quot; &quot;Fabienne&quot; &quot;Fabio&quot; &quot;Magdalena&quot; &quot;Tim&quot; ## [11] &quot;Alex&quot; &quot;Tobias&quot; &quot;Michael&quot; &quot;Sabrina&quot; &quot;Valentin&quot; ## [16] &quot;Tristan&quot; &quot;Martin&quot; &quot;Anna&quot; &quot;Andreas&quot; &quot;Florian&quot; 3.4 Subsetting observations / rows in data frames Using the same indexing technique, you can also select an entire row by providing a row index and leaving the column index blank: survey[1,] # row index = 1 ## X.2 X.1 X name age date outlet outlet_use outlet_trust ## 1 1 1 1 Alexandra 20 2021-09-09 TV 2 5 3.5 Subsetting values / cells in data frames You can subset values of a data set by calling a variable by its name. You just have to specify the data frame, the variable name AND the row index. For example, let’s look only at the first name in the data, which is Alexandra. survey$name[1] ## [1] &quot;Alexandra&quot; Any educated guesses on how to access the exact same value using the column index instead of the column name? Yeah, we enter the row index first, followed by a comma, and finish with the column index: survey[1,4] # row index = 1, column index = 4 ## [1] &quot;Alexandra&quot; Of course, you can use complex indexing on data frames. Let’s look at the first ten rows of the fourth (name) and fifth (age) column: survey[1:10,4:5] ## name age ## 1 Alexandra 20 ## 2 Alex 25 ## 3 Maximilian 29 ## 4 Moritz 22 ## 5 Vanessa 25 ## 6 Andrea 26 ## 7 Fabienne 26 ## 8 Fabio 27 ## 9 Magdalena 8 ## 10 Tim 26 3.6 Subsetting data with conditions Let’s say we want to select all names of students who are older than 25. This time, we’ll need to use a condition to select our rows: survey[survey$age &gt; 25,4] ## [1] &quot;Maximilian&quot; &quot;Andrea&quot; &quot;Fabienne&quot; &quot;Fabio&quot; &quot;Tim&quot; ## [6] &quot;Alex&quot; &quot;Tobias&quot; &quot;Sabrina&quot; &quot;Valentin&quot; &quot;Tristan&quot; ## [11] &quot;Florian&quot; # Read: I want to select column 4 (name) from the survey data frame # and display all rows in which the age column of the survey data frame has a value &gt; 25 Alternatively, if you want to show all columns that belong to students who are older than 25, you would do it like that: survey[survey$age &gt; 25,] ## X.2 X.1 X name age date outlet outlet_use outlet_trust ## 3 3 3 3 Maximilian 29 2021-09-09 Zeitung 4 1 ## 6 6 6 6 Andrea 26 2021-09-09 Online 3 4 ## 7 7 7 7 Fabienne 26 2021-09-09 TV 3 2 ## 8 8 8 8 Fabio 27 2021-09-09 Online 0 1 ## 10 10 10 10 Tim 26 2021-09-07 TV NA 2 ## 11 11 11 11 Alex 27 2021-09-09 Online NA 2 ## 12 12 12 12 Tobias 26 2021-09-07 Online 2 2 ## 14 14 14 14 Sabrina 27 2021-09-08 Online 1 2 ## 15 15 15 15 Valentin 29 2021-09-09 TV 1 5 ## 16 16 16 16 Tristan 26 2021-09-09 TV 2 5 ## 20 20 20 20 Florian 26 2021-09-09 Online 1 5 Of course, you can index more than one column: survey[survey$age &gt; 25,4:5] ## name age ## 3 Maximilian 29 ## 6 Andrea 26 ## 7 Fabienne 26 ## 8 Fabio 27 ## 10 Tim 26 ## 11 Alex 27 ## 12 Tobias 26 ## 14 Sabrina 27 ## 15 Valentin 29 ## 16 Tristan 26 ## 20 Florian 26 Finally, you can use multiple conditions: survey[survey$age &gt;= 25 &amp; survey$outlet_trust &lt; 3,] ## X.2 X.1 X name age date outlet outlet_use outlet_trust ## 3 3 3 3 Maximilian 29 2021-09-09 Zeitung 4 1 ## 7 7 7 7 Fabienne 26 2021-09-09 TV 3 2 ## 8 8 8 8 Fabio 27 2021-09-09 Online 0 1 ## 10 10 10 10 Tim 26 2021-09-07 TV NA 2 ## 11 11 11 11 Alex 27 2021-09-09 Online NA 2 ## 12 12 12 12 Tobias 26 2021-09-07 Online 2 2 ## 13 13 13 13 Michael 25 2021-09-09 Online 3 2 ## 14 14 14 14 Sabrina 27 2021-09-08 Online 1 2 3.7 Take-Aways Setting the working directory: tells R where your folder with the data is located on your drive, setwd(your_filepath) Import data: after setting the working directory, with read.csv() (comma-separated) or read.csv2() (semicolon-separated) Access variables: either by the access operator $ (dataframe&amp;variablename) or by the column index [,columnNo.] Access values: by indexing, i.e. using [ ] and row + column indices Conditions: you can select rows based on conditions, e.g.: greater &gt;, greater or equal &gt;=, equal ==, and not equal != 3.8 Additional tutorials You still have questions?

You might wonder why we’ve spent so much time exploring functions in Base R to now learn data management with tidyverse. After all, data management can also be done in Base R, can’t it? I personally recommend that all R beginners should work with the tidyverse as early as possible. There are three reasons supporting my argument: Ease of use: The tidyverse is very accessible for R “beginners”, i.e. its syntax is very easy to understand. It allows you to set goals (i.e. what you want to do with your data) and get you working on these goals very quickly. Definitely more quickly than in Base R! Standard for data management: A few years ago, the tidyverse has become the de facto standard for data management in R. It is a meta-package, which means that it is a collection of distinct packages that all follow the same design principles to make code reading and writing as simple as possible. For example, all functions are named after verbs that indicate exactly what they perform (e.g. filter or summarize). Beautiful graphs: With the tidyverse, all data management steps can be swiftly transferred into beautiful graphs. This is because the most popular graph package in R, ggplot2, is part of the tidyverse. Are you excited now? Then let’s get started! 4.2 Tidyverse packages The tidyverse comes with a great arsenal of topic-specific packages and their respective functions. It includes packages for: tibble: creating data structures like tibbles, which is an enhanced type of data frame readr, haven, readxl: reading data (e.g. readr for CSV, haven for SPSS, Stata and SAS, readxl for Excel) tidyr, dplyr: data transformation, modification, and summary statistics stringr, forcats, lubridate: create special, powerful object types (e.g. stringr for working with text objects, forcats for factors, lubridate for time data) purrr: programming with R ggplot2: graphing/charting The most frequently used packages of the tidyverse can be installed and activated in one go (less frequently used packages like haven still need to be installed and activated separately): install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) # install the package (only on the first time) library(tidyverse) # active the package 4.3 Tidy data Dataframes, which we learned about in [Types of objects], are tabular data. However, data can also have other formats, for example as nested, i.e. hierarchical, lists. In communication research, these other data formats are mainly used by social media and their respective APIs (perhaps you have heard of the “JSON” format before). In our course, however, we’ll focus on tabular data.The same data can be represented differently in tables. We perceive some of these representations as tidy, others as messy. While tidy data principles establish a standard for organizing data values inside a data frame and thus all tidy data look the same, every messy dataset is messy in its own way. Take a look at the table below. It shows a Starwars data set that comes pre-installed with the dplyr package. Do you feel the tabled data is messy? Why (not)? ## # A tibble: 10 × 3 ## name body_feature value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Anakin Skywalker height 188 ## 2 Anakin Skywalker mass 84 ## 3 Chewbacca height 228 ## 4 Chewbacca mass 112 ## 5 Darth Vader height 202 ## 6 Darth Vader mass 136 ## 7 Jabba Desilijic Tiure height 175 ## 8 Jabba Desilijic Tiure mass 1358 ## 9 Leia Organa height 150 ## 10 Leia Organa mass 49 Overall, this data is messy. It comes with three messy problems: This body_feature column comprises information relating to both height and weight, i.e. both variables are stored in a single column. As a result, the value column is reliant on the body_feature column; we can’t tell the stored values apart by merely looking at the value column. We always need to check the body_feature column. Consequently, we have issues with vectorized functions (remember, in R, columns in data sets are vectors): We can’t, for example, use the mean() function on the value column to determine the average weight of the Star Wars characters since the height values are also stored there. What do you think of this table? Is it messy? ## # A tibble: 5 × 3 ## name height mass ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Anakin Skywalker 188 84 ## 2 Chewbacca 228 112 ## 3 Darth Vader 202 136 ## 4 Jabba Desilijic Tiure 175 1358 ## 5 Leia Organa 150 49 This table looks tidy! Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. We determine whether a dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. We consider a table tidy when it follows the following golden rules: Columns: Every column is one variable. Rows: Every row is one observation. Cells: Every cell contains one single value. Image: The tidy data principle (Source: R for Data Science) In messy data sets, on the other hand… Column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables are stored in one column. Variables are stored in both rows and columns. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. Why should you be concerned about tidy data organization? There are two major advantages: When you have a consistent data structure, it is easier to learn the respective tools that work well with this data structure. dplyr, ggplot2, and all the other tidyverse packages are designed for working with tidy data. Putting variables in columns makes R’s vectorized nature shine. The majority of built-in R-functions (like the mean() function) works with vectors of values. As a result, the tidy reorganization of data seems only natural for a good work flow in R. If you have been working mainly with survey data, then you will already be familiar with these basic rules, as data export from survey software usually follows these principles. However, “real-world” data from databases or social media often does not follow these principles. That’s why it’s sometimes true to say that 80% of data analysis is spent on cleaning and transforming data. 4.4 The pipe operator Truly, dplyr is my favorite tidyverse package (even more so than ggplot2, which we’ll cover later!). It allows you to perform powerful data transformations in just a few simple steps. To this end, dplyr relies on the pipe operator (%&gt;%).2 The %&gt;% operator allows functions to be applied sequentially to the same source object in a concise manner, so that step-by-step transformations can be applied to the data. Therefore, we always call the source object first and then add each transformation step separated by the %&gt;% operator. Let’s illustrate this concept with an example. We’ll use the Starwars data set that you are already familiar with. starwars_data %&gt;% # First, we define the source object, i.e. the data frame that we want to transform, followed by the pipe operator plot() # Second, we specify which function should be performed on the source object, here: scatterplot Now, that’s not very impressive. We could do the same in Base R like this: plot(starwars_data) However, dplyr gets really impressive when you chain functions sequentially. You can apply certain selection criteria to your data and plot it in one go. For example, we might exclude the variable name from our scatter plot, since it’s not a metric variable anyway. Also, we might want to look only at those Star Wars characters taller than 170 cm. Let’s try it in a single run! starwars_data %&gt;% # Define the source object select(height, mass) %&gt;% # Keep only the height and mass column filter(height &gt; 170) %&gt;% # Filter all observations that are taller than 170cm plot() # Plot! Now try to do the same in Base R: plot(starwars_data[starwars_data$height&gt;170,]$mass~starwars_data[starwars_data$height&gt;170,]$height, xlab=&quot;height&quot;, ylab=&quot;mass&quot;) The Base R code is longer, more nested, and not as readable as the code written in dplyr. And the more selection criteria and functions you need to implement, the worse it gets. For example, imagine you would also want to exclude Star Wars characters with a mass bigger than 1200kg. Peace of cake with dplyr: starwars_data %&gt;% select(height, mass) %&gt;% filter(height &gt; 170) %&gt;% filter(mass &lt; 1200) %&gt;% plot() 4.5 Data transformation with dplyr dplyrcomes with five main functions: select(): select variables column by column, i.e. pick columns / variables by their names filter(): filter observations row by row, i.e. pick observations by their values arrange(): sort / reorder data in ascending or descending order mutate(): calculate new variables or transform existing ones summarize(): summarize variables (e.g. mean, standard deviation, etc.), best combined with group_by() 4.5.1 select() Scientists will frequently provide you with large data sets including hundreds of variables (often even more!). The first problem in this scenario is narrowing down the variables you are truly interested in. select() helps you to easily choose a suitable subset of variables. In this selection process, the name of the data frame is the source object, followed by the pipe %&gt;% operator. The expression that selects the columns that you are interested in comes after that. Take the Star Wars data, for example. The original data set has 87 observations (Star Wars characters) and 14 columns / variables (traits of these characters, e.g., birth_year, gender, and species). Yes, 14 columns is not a lot and you could get an overview of this data without subsetting columns. Let’s take a look at the original data frame: library(dplyr) # load dplyr starwars_data &lt;- starwars # assign the pre-installed starwars data from dplyr to a source object / variable starwars_data # print the content of the data frame to the console ## # A tibble: 87 × 14 ## name height mass hair_…¹ skin_…² eye_c…³ birth…⁴ sex gender homew…⁵ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywa… 172 77 blond fair blue 19 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 2 C-3PO 167 75 &lt;NA&gt; gold yellow 112 none mascu… Tatooi… ## 3 R2-D2 96 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red 33 none mascu… Naboo ## 4 Darth Vader 202 136 none white yellow 41.9 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 5 Leia Organa 150 49 brown light brown 19 fema… femin… Aldera… ## 6 Owen Lars 178 120 brown,… light blue 52 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 7 Beru White… 165 75 brown light blue 47 fema… femin… Tatooi… ## 8 R5-D4 97 32 &lt;NA&gt; white,… red NA none mascu… Tatooi… ## 9 Biggs Dark… 183 84 black light brown 24 male mascu… Tatooi… ## 10 Obi-Wan Ke… 182 77 auburn… fair blue-g… 57 male mascu… Stewjon ## # … with 77 more rows, 4 more variables: species &lt;chr&gt;, films &lt;list&gt;, ## # vehicles &lt;list&gt;, starships &lt;list&gt;, and abbreviated variable names ## # ¹​hair_color, ²​skin_color, ³​eye_color, ⁴​birth_year, ⁵​homeworld For the sake of practice, let’s say we only want to analyze the species, birth_year, mass, and height of these characters. To simplify data handling, we want to keep only the respective columns. starwars_data %&gt;% # define the source object select(name, species, birth_year, mass, height) # keep only the name, species, birth_year, mass and height column ## # A tibble: 87 × 5 ## name species birth_year mass height ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker Human 19 77 172 ## 2 C-3PO Droid 112 75 167 ## 3 R2-D2 Droid 33 32 96 ## 4 Darth Vader Human 41.9 136 202 ## 5 Leia Organa Human 19 49 150 ## 6 Owen Lars Human 52 120 178 ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars Human 47 75 165 ## 8 R5-D4 Droid NA 32 97 ## 9 Biggs Darklighter Human 24 84 183 ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi Human 57 77 182 ## # … with 77 more rows At the moment you have only printed the transformed data to the console. However, most of the time we want to keep the transformed data ready for further calculations. In this case we should assign the transformed data into a new source object, which we can access later. starwars_short &lt;- starwars_data %&gt;% # assign a new source object and define the old source object select(name, species, birth_year, mass, height) # keep only the name, species, birth_year, mass and height column Let’s print the new source object, starwars_short, to the console. starwars_short ## # A tibble: 87 × 5 ## name species birth_year mass height ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker Human 19 77 172 ## 2 C-3PO Droid 112 75 167 ## 3 R2-D2 Droid 33 32 96 ## 4 Darth Vader Human 41.9 136 202 ## 5 Leia Organa Human 19 49 150 ## 6 Owen Lars Human 52 120 178 ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars Human 47 75 165 ## 8 R5-D4 Droid NA 32 97 ## 9 Biggs Darklighter Human 24 84 183 ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi Human 57 77 182 ## # … with 77 more rows You can also delete columns by making a reverse selection with the - symbol.

Here is an overview: Image: Logical, i.e. boolean, operators (Source: R for Data Science) Tip for advanced users 1: You can negate filters. This means that you keep all observations except the one that you have specified with the != operator (read != as: is not or is unequal to). For example, you can choose to include only non-human Star Wars characters. starwars_short %&gt;% filter(species!=&quot;Human&quot;) ## # A tibble: 48 × 5 ## name species birth_year mass height ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 C-3PO Droid 112 75 167 ## 2 R2-D2 Droid 33 32 96 ## 3 R5-D4 Droid NA 32 97 ## 4 Chewbacca Wookiee 200 112 228 ## 5 Greedo Rodian 44 74 173 ## 6 Jabba Desilijic Tiure Hutt 600 1358 175 ## 7 Yoda Yoda&#39;s species 896 17 66 ## 8 IG-88 Droid 15 140 200 ## 9 Bossk Trandoshan 53 113 190 ## 10 Ackbar Mon Calamari 41 83 180 ## # … with 38 more rows Alternatively, you achieve the same goal by negating the entire function call.

This one can be tricky to negate! For example, with this code you get all characters that are NEITHER human NOR older than 33 years. I.e. you get all non-human characters who are younger than 33 or exactly 33 years old. starwars_short %&gt;% filter(!((species == &quot;Human&quot;) | (birth_year &gt; 33))) ## # A tibble: 4 × 5 ## name species birth_year mass height ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 R2-D2 Droid 33 32 96 ## 2 IG-88 Droid 15 140 200 ## 3 Wicket Systri Warrick Ewok 8 20 88 ## 4 Plo Koon Kel Dor 22 80 188 But with this code, you’ll get all observations that are either non-human (regardless of their age) OR humans who are older than 33 years old. starwars_short %&gt;% filter((species != &quot;Human&quot;) | (birth_year &gt; 33)) ## # A tibble: 67 × 5 ## name species birth_year mass height ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 C-3PO Droid 112 75 167 ## 2 R2-D2 Droid 33 32 96 ## 3 Darth Vader Human 41.9 136 202 ## 4 Owen Lars Human 52 120 178 ## 5 Beru Whitesun lars Human 47 75 165 ## 6 R5-D4 Droid NA 32 97 ## 7 Obi-Wan Kenobi Human 57 77 182 ## 8 Anakin Skywalker Human 41.9 84 188 ## 9 Wilhuff Tarkin Human 64 NA 180 ## 10 Chewbacca Wookiee 200 112 228 ## # … with 57 more rows 4.5.3 arrange() arrange() and filter() are like two brothers: both look similar, but they also differ in at least one essential aspect. Both functions change the rows of the data frame, but unlike filter(), arrange() does not select or delete rows, it only changes their order (either ascending or descending). By default, arrange() will sort in ascending order, i.e. from 1:100 (numeric vector) and from A:Z (character vector). arrange() must always be applied to at least one column that is to be sorted. starwars_short %&gt;% arrange(birth_year) ## # A tibble: 87 × 5 ## name species birth_year mass height ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Wicket Systri Warrick Ewok 8 20 88 ## 2 IG-88 Droid 15 140 200 ## 3 Luke Skywalker Human 19 77 172 ## 4 Leia Organa Human 19 49 150 ## 5 Wedge Antilles Human 21 77 170 ## 6 Plo Koon Kel Dor 22 80 188 ## 7 Biggs Darklighter Human 24 84 183 ## 8 Han Solo Human 29 80 180 ## 9 Lando Calrissian Human 31 79 177 ## 10 Boba Fett Human 31.5 78.2 183 ## # … with 77 more rows To get a descending order: starwars_short %&gt;% arrange(desc(birth_year)) ## # A tibble: 87 × 5 ## name species birth_year mass height ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Yoda Yoda&#39;s species 896 17 66 ## 2 Jabba Desilijic Tiure Hutt 600 1358 175 ## 3 Chewbacca Wookiee 200 112 228 ## 4 C-3PO Droid 112 75 167 ## 5 Dooku Human 102 80 193 ## 6 Qui-Gon Jinn Human 92 89 193 ## 7 Ki-Adi-Mundi Cerean 92 82 198 ## 8 Finis Valorum Human 91 NA 170 ## 9 Palpatine Human 82 75 170 ## 10 Cliegg Lars Human 82 NA 183 ## # … with 77 more rows If you specify more than one column, then subsequent columns are used to break ties.

With mutate(), new columns will be added to the end of you data frame. For example, we can resize the height column to provide the body height in m instead of cm. Let’s call that variable m_height. We’ll assign our transformed data (with the newly created m_height column) back into our source object (starwars_short) to keep the changes for the future (and not just print it to the console). starwars_short &lt;- starwars_short %&gt;% # assigns your source object, i.e. data, back to itself to save changes mutate(m_height=height/100) # creates the new variable &quot;m_height&quot; and adds it to the end of the data frame starwars_short # print the data to your console to inspect the new column ## # A tibble: 87 × 6 ## name species birth_year mass height m_height ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker Human 19 77 172 1.72 ## 2 C-3PO Droid 112 75 167 1.67 ## 3 R2-D2 Droid 33 32 96 0.96 ## 4 Darth Vader Human 41.9 136 202 2.02 ## 5 Leia Organa Human 19 49 150 1.5 ## 6 Owen Lars Human 52 120 178 1.78 ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars Human 47 75 165 1.65 ## 8 R5-D4 Droid NA 32 97 0.97 ## 9 Biggs Darklighter Human 24 84 183 1.83 ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi Human 57 77 182 1.82 ## # … with 77 more rows Let’s calculate the BMI of the Star Wars characters with the BMI formula and the newly created m_height variable.

Let’s be crazy and recode all droids as robots3 and save the result in a new variable called crazy_species! Please note that recode() has an unusual syntax because it follows the order of old_var = new_var instead of the usual order: new_var = old_var. Therefore, recode() is likely to be retired in the future (use case_when instead). starwars_short &lt;- starwars_short %&gt;% mutate(crazy_species=recode( # alternatively, you could also recode directly back into the species variable species, &quot;Droid&quot;=&quot;Robot&quot;)) starwars_short ## # A tibble: 87 × 9 ## name species birth…¹ mass height m_hei…² BMI age_cat crazy…³ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker Human 19 77 172 1.72 26.0 very y… Human ## 2 C-3PO Droid 112 75 167 1.67 26.9 very o… Robot ## 3 R2-D2 Droid 33 32 96 0.96 34.7 young Robot ## 4 Darth Vader Human 41.9 136 202 2.02 33.3 mid-ag… Human ## 5 Leia Organa Human 19 49 150 1.5 21.8 very y… Human ## 6 Owen Lars Human 52 120 178 1.78 37.9 mid-ag… Human ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars Human 47 75 165 1.65 27.5 mid-ag… Human ## 8 R5-D4 Droid NA 32 97 0.97 34.0 &lt;NA&gt; Robot ## 9 Biggs Darklighter Human 24 84 183 1.83 25.1 young Human ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi Human 57 77 182 1.82 23.2 mid-ag… Human ## # … with 77 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​birth_year, ²​m_height, ## # ³​crazy_species Tip for advanced users 1: There is a special case of recoding: Sometimes you will receive data (e.g. through an import from SPSS) in which missings are not marked as NA, but with -9 (or any other number). Unfortunately, you will have to tell R that these are missing values and should be set to NA. In this case, use the na_if() function, which is also part of the mutate() function. Luke Skywalker, the first observation in our data frame, is 172cm tall. For the sake of practice, let’s set all heights that are equal to 172cm to NA. This time, we won’t save this transformation for later use (by reassigning the source object back to itself) since this transformation does not make a lot of sense. starwars_short %&gt;% mutate(height= na_if(height, 172)) ## # A tibble: 87 × 9 ## name species birth…¹ mass height m_hei…² BMI age_cat crazy…³ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Luke Skywalker Human 19 77 NA 1.72 26.0 very y… Human ## 2 C-3PO Droid 112 75 167 1.67 26.9 very o… Robot ## 3 R2-D2 Droid 33 32 96 0.96 34.7 young Robot ## 4 Darth Vader Human 41.9 136 202 2.02 33.3 mid-ag… Human ## 5 Leia Organa Human 19 49 150 1.5 21.8 very y… Human ## 6 Owen Lars Human 52 120 178 1.78 37.9 mid-ag… Human ## 7 Beru Whitesun lars Human 47 75 165 1.65 27.5 mid-ag… Human ## 8 R5-D4 Droid NA 32 97 0.97 34.0 &lt;NA&gt; Robot ## 9 Biggs Darklighter Human 24 84 183 1.83 25.1 young Human ## 10 Obi-Wan Kenobi Human 57 77 182 1.82 23.2 mid-ag… Human ## # … with 77 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​birth_year, ²​m_height, ## # ³​crazy_species 4.5.5 summarize() [+ group_by()] Instead of using summarize(), you could omit the American English and write summarise(). This function collapses a data frame into a single row that shows you summary statistics about your variables. Be careful not to overwrite your source object with the collapsed data frame, i.e. do not reassign the source object to itself when you use summarize() (unless you have a really good reason to do so). starwars_short %&gt;% summarize(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm=TRUE)) # collapses the data frame into one variable called &quot;mean_height&quot; ## # A tibble: 1 × 1 ## mean_height ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 174. # na.rm = TRUE -&gt; removes the missing values prior to the computation of the summary We now know that the average Star Wars character is 174cm tall.

But Ewoks are even smaller (88cm on average). Pro tip: you can even group by two groups at the same time with the method group_by(x1, x2, .add=TRUE). Finally, we can also retrieve all relevant summary statistics of a classic box plot: starwars_short %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% # every unique species becomes its own group summarize(MAX = max(height, na.rm = TRUE), UQ= quantile(height, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE), Med = median(height, na.rm = TRUE), M = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), # SD = sd(height, na.rm = TRUE), # calculating the standard deviation is useless here because we often have only 1 observation per species LQ= quantile(height, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), MIN = min(height, na.rm = TRUE), count = n() # shows the group_size (i.e. count) ) ## # A tibble: 38 × 8 ## species MAX UQ Med M LQ MIN count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Aleena 79 79 79 79 79 79 1 ## 2 Besalisk 198 198 198 198 198 198 1 ## 3 Cerean 198 198 198 198 198 198 1 ## 4 Chagrian 196 196 196 196 196 196 1 ## 5 Clawdite 168 168 168 168 168 168 1 ## 6 Droid 200 167 97 131. 96 96 6 ## 7 Dug 112 112 112 112 112 112 1 ## 8 Ewok 88 88 88 88 88 88 1 ## 9 Geonosian 183 183 183 183 183 183 1 ## 10 Gungan 224 215 206 209. 201 196 3 ## # … with 28 more rows Tip for advances users 2: If you want to count the unique values of variables, then data %&gt;% group_by(a, b) %&gt;% summarize(n = n()) might not be the best solution (it’s a lot of code, isn’t it?). starwars_short %&gt;% group_by(species, age_cat) %&gt;% summarize(count = n()) ## # A tibble: 51 × 3 ## # Groups: species [38] ## species age_cat count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Aleena &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 2 Besalisk &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 3 Cerean old 1 ## 4 Chagrian &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 5 Clawdite &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 6 Droid very old 1 ## 7 Droid very young 1 ## 8 Droid young 1 ## 9 Droid &lt;NA&gt; 3 ## 10 Dug &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## # … with 41 more rows For more efficient code, you can use the count() function instead: data %&gt;% count(a, b). starwars_short %&gt;% count(species, age_cat) ## # A tibble: 51 × 3 ## species age_cat n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Aleena &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 2 Besalisk &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 3 Cerean old 1 ## 4 Chagrian &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 5 Clawdite &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## 6 Droid very old 1 ## 7 Droid very young 1 ## 8 Droid young 1 ## 9 Droid &lt;NA&gt; 3 ## 10 Dug &lt;NA&gt; 1 ## # … with 41 more rows 4.5.6 Chaining functions in a pipe All of the dplyr functions can be chained in one single pipe. Using the original starwars_data, we’ll only analyze Star Wars characters who are older than 25 years (filter()), calculate the BMI (mutate()), group them by their species (group_by()) and summarize the average BMI (summarize()). We’ll display the final result in an ascending order (arrange()). starwars_data %&gt;% mutate(BMI = mass/(height/100)^2) %&gt;% filter(birth_year&gt;25) %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarize(mean_BMI = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% arrange(mean_BMI) ## # A tibble: 14 × 2 ## species mean_BMI ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Gungan 17.2 ## 2 Twi&#39;lek 17.4 ## 3 Mirialan 18.8 ## 4 Cerean 20.9 ## 5 Wookiee 21.5 ## 6 Rodian 24.7 ## 7 Human 25.3 ## 8 Mon Calamari 25.6 ## 9 Zabrak 26.1 ## 10 Droid 30.8 ## 11 Trandoshan 31.3 ## 12 Yoda&#39;s species 39.0 ## 13 Hutt 443. ## 14 &lt;NA&gt; NaN 4.6 Take-Aways Tidy data: is a tabular in which each column represents one single variable, each row represents a single observation and each cell contains only one single value Pipe operator: %&gt;% is used to chain functions and apply them to a source object. We call these chains of functions pipes dplyr functions: there are five main dplyr functions that you should know of: select, filter, arrange, mutate, and summarize [+ group_by]. 4.7 Additional tutorials You still have questions?

"],["tutorial-data-visualization-with-ggplot.html", " 5 Tutorial: Data visualization with ggplot 5.1 Why not stick with Base R? 5.2 Components of a ggplot graph 5.3 Installing &amp; activating ggplot 5.4 Building your first plot", " 5 Tutorial: Data visualization with ggplot After working through Tutorial 5, you’ll… know what each graphical component of a ggplot graph contributes to the final visualization understand the grammer of graphics (or simply: the ggplot2 syntax) to combine graphical components know how to make your own data visualizations using ggplot2 5.1 Why not stick with Base R? The ggplot2 package, i.e. the data visualization package of tidyverse, has become the R package for data visualization. While Base R can be used to visualize data, the ggplot2 package makes data visualization so much easier that I recommend starting with ggplot2 right away and skipping data visualization in Base R altogether. The gg in ggplot2 stands for grammar of graphics, which means that we can describe each component of a graph layer by layer and component by component. You only have to provide ggplot() with a source object (i.e. data) and specify what variables it should map to the aesthetical attributes (color, shape, size) of certain geometric objects (points, lines, bars) – and ggplot will take care of the rest! The inventor of ggplot2, Hadley Wickham, describes the benefits of ggplot2 like this: “In order to unlock the full power of ggplot2, you’ll need to master the underlying grammar. By understanding the grammar, and how its components fit together, you can create a wider range of visualizations, combine multiple sources of data, and customise to your heart’s content… The grammar makes it easier for you to iteratively update a plot, changing a single feature at a time. The grammar is also useful because it suggests the high-level aspects of a plot that can be changed, giving you a framework to think about graphics, and hopefully shortening the distance from mind to paper. It also encourages the use of graphics customised to a particular problem, rather than relying on specific chart types.” (Wickham et al., 2021, no page; bold words inserted) Just as dplyr simplifies data manipulation, ggplot2 simplifies data visualization. In addition, ggplot2 and dplyr work hand in hand: You can prepare your data selection and manipulation with dplyr and pipe it directly into ggplot to turn your transformed data into a beautiful graph. With only a few lines of code, you can produce graphs like this one: This is the code. Right now, it might still look a bit overwhelming to you, but once you’ve understood the grammar of graphics, it really is a just a small jigsaw puzzle. Moreover, you don’t usually start with graphs that are this complicated, but with basic scatter or bar plots. library(ggplot2) plot &lt;- starwars_data %&gt;% filter(species == &quot;Human&quot; | species == &quot;Droid&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size = birth_year, fill = species)) + geom_point(shape = 21, alpha = 0.25, color = &quot;black&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) + ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = name), size = 2.3) + theme_bw() + labs(title = &quot;Mass vs. height of humans and droids in Star Wars&quot;, x = &quot;Height (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Weight (kg)&quot;) + facet_wrap(~species) To visit the official documentation of ggplot2: 1. type ?ggplot2 in your console 2. visit the ggplot documentation 3. visit the ggplot homepage of the tidyverse 5.2 Components of a ggplot graph As mentioned before, the main idea behind ggplot is to generate a statistical plot by combining layers that represent geometric objects (e.g. points and lines). By linking data to the aesthetic features of these geometric objects (e.g. colors, size, transparency), the aesthetic properties of the geometric objects may be controlled. In the words of Wickham: “A graphic maps the data to the aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars).” Wickham et al., 2021, no page; bold words inserted Image: The logic of adding layer by layer in ggplot (Source: R @ Ewah 2020): The necessary components of a ggplot graph are: Source object / data: The data that you would like to visualize. Geometries geom_: Geom options allow you to specify what geometric objects will represent the data (i.e. points, bars, lines, and many more). Aesthetics aes(): Aesthetics allows you to map variables to the x- and y-axis and to the aesthetics of those geometric objects (i.e. position, color, size, shape, linetype, and transparency). The complementary, but not necessary components of a ggplot graph are: Scales scale_: Scale options allow you to fine-tune the mapping from the variables to the aesthetics. You can fine-tune axis limits, tick breaks, grid lines, or any other axis/geometric object transformations that depend on the range of a specific scale. Statistical transformations stat_: Allows you to produce statistical summaries of the data for visualization (i.e. means and standard deviations, fitted curves, and many more). Coordinate system coord_: Allows you to change the appearance of your coordinate system (i.e. flip the coordinates to turn horizontal bar chart into a vertical one). Position: to adjust overlapping objects, e.g. jittering, stacking or dodging. Facets facet_: Allows you to divide your plot into multiple subplots. Visual themes theme(): Allows you to specify the visual basics of a plot, such as background, default typeface, sizes, and colors. Axis labels labs(): Allows you to change the plot’s main title and the axis labels. 5.3 Installing &amp; activating ggplot You can always activate ggplot2 by activating the meta-package tidyverse: library(tidyverse) If for some reason you do not want to activate the whole tidyverse, you should install ggplot2 and activate this package separately: install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) # install the package (only on the first time) library(ggplot2) # active the package 5.4 Building your first plot In the next sections, you will create your very first plot – layer by layer. We will look at some of the most important components that you will regularly add to graphs and you will learn how to make use of them. 5.4.1 Data Obviously, you need data to perform data visualization. Therefore, our first step is to load the starwars data, but let’s keep only humans and droids for now. To this end, assign your transformed data to a new data frame called human_droid_data. human_droid_data &lt;- dplyr::starwars %&gt;% filter(species == &quot;Human&quot; | species == &quot;Droid&quot;) The function ggplot() can only create a plot if we explicitly tell the function what data to use, so this graphical component is necessary. Using our dplyr skills, let’s use the human_droid_data as our source object and apply the ggplot() function to it by using a pipe (i.e. %&gt;%). human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot() The ggplot() function creates a blank canvas (i.e. first layer). We now have to draw on it. 5.4.2 Aesthetics To draw on this blank canvas, we must at least tell the ggplot() function which variables to assign to the x- and y-axis by using the aes() function. Thus, the Aesthetics graph component is also necessary in every single plot. human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass)) The aes() function allows you to specify the following arguments (and many more, as you will learn over time): x: the variable that should be mapped to the x axis y: the variable that should be mapped to the y size: the variable that should be used for determining the size of a geometric object fill: the variable that should be used for filling a geometric object with a specific color color: the variable that should be used for outlining a geometric object with a specific color 5.4.3 Geometrics Finally, we can turn to the last necessary component of any ggplot graph: the geometric objects that fill your canvas. The choice of these geometric objects determines what kind of chart you create. The geom_ component of the ggplot() function allows you to create the following chart types (and many more, as you will learn over time): geom_bar(): to create a bar chart geom_histogram: to create a histogram geom_line(): to create a line graph geom_point(): to create a scatter or bubble plot geom_boxplot(): to create a box plot Now let’s add the data points (x,y) with geom_point() to our canvas to make it a scatter plot: human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point() That’s a scatter plot for sure! And you only needed three necessary components to create it: data (i.e. a source object), aesthetics aes(), and geometric objects geom_. 5.4.4 Scales A scale is a mapping from data to the final values that computers can use to actually show the aesthetics. In this sense, a scale regulates the aesthetic mapping of variables to aesthetics. Providing a scale_ is not necessary to create a graph, but it allows you to fine-tune aesthetic mappings to customize your graph. scale_ is very powerful and over time, you will learn about a lot of things that you can customize with it. For now, we will only focus on a few of these. We will use scale_ to : change the limits and ticks of the x and y axis change how a third variable (besides x and y) is mapped to the aesthetics of our geometric object First, we will use scale_ to modify the x and the y axis by providing the graph with new axis limits. human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + # modify the y axis limits scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) # modify the x axis limits Second, we’ll add more ticks to make the graph better readable. human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass)) + geom_point() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + # choose where the ticks of the y axis appear scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) # choose where the ticks of the x axis appear Until now, we have used scale_ to transform only the axes. But we can also use it to change the mapping of variables to geometric objects. To demonstrate this, we now add another variable to our graph, namely the age (birth_year) of the humanoid and droid Star Wars characters. Let’s map age to our data points (i.e. geom_point()) so that larger bubbles reflect older age. human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year)) + # map birth_year (age) to the size of the following geometric objects geom_point() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) Personally, I feel like these bubbles could use a little bit of rescaling to make age differences stand out more. In addition, you could get a nicer title for the size legend than “birth_year”. Let’s try that. human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year)) + geom_point() + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) # sets the bubbles&#39; size in a range between 1 and 11 and renames the respective legend title to &quot;age&quot; Perfect! The legend spells “age” and age differences seem a bit more obvious now. Unfortunately, some data points are now overlapping. I think this is a good time to introduce you to the differences between using scale_ and adding aesthetics to the geom_ objects directly. While the former allows you to change the mapping from variables to the aesthetics of geometric objects, the latter one allows you to provide a constant. This means that the aesthetic mapping does not depend on the values of a variable, but is set to a single default value. To demonstrate this and fix the overlap of our bubbles, we change the transparency value of the bubbles so that they become transparent. Note that all the values given are constants, which means that they do not depend on a third variable like birth_year. human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.25, color = &quot;black&quot;) + # shape = 21 is creating bubbles that have a border (i.e. outline), fill = &quot;black&quot; fills the bubble with black ink, alpha = 0.25 to make the bubbles` black ink 25% transparent and color = &quot;black&quot; to make the border (i.e. outline) pitch black scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) This looks way more readable. I think we are ready to move on to Themes. 5.4.5 Themes Just like scale_, theme_is an optional ggplot component, i.e. not necessary. Themes are visually appealing presets for charts, e.g., they influence whether grid lines are visible or whether certain color palettes are applied to the data. By using themes you can make your graphs more beautiful and give them a consistent style without any effort, which is especially useful for longer texts like theses. To familiarize yourself with the various options, take a look at this overview of all ggplot2 themes. If you don’t like grid lines, for example, theme_classic() might be to your taste: human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.25, color = &quot;black&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) + theme_classic() Personally, I really enjoy the theme_bw() (black-and-white theme). So let’s apply it to our graph: human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.25, color = &quot;black&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) + theme_bw() 5.4.6 Labs Again, labs() is not a necessary, but an optional component of your graph. Using the labs() function allows you to set a main title for your plot and to change the labels of the x and y axis. Let’s try it: human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.25, color = &quot;black&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(title = &quot;Mass vs. height of humans and droids in Star Wars&quot;, x = &quot;Height (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Weight (kg)&quot;) Now that we’ve added a main title, it becomes clear that we can’t really distinguish the data points that represent humans from those that represent droids. 5.4.7 Facets Faceting divides plot into tiny subplots, which display different subsets of your data. Facets are an effective way to explore your data because they allow you to rapidly detect divergent patterns in these subsets. Of course, faceting is optional, i.e. not necessary. You don’t need faceting if you don’t want to compare different groups within your data. The two approaches to faceting are: facet_wrap(): uses the levels of one (or more) variable(s) to create groups + panels for each group; useful if you have a single categorical variable with many levels facet_grid(): produces a matrix of panels defined by two variables which form the rows and columns Image: The logic of faceting (Source: Wickham et al., 2021): Let’s use the facet_wrap() function to create two subplots for our two different levels of the species variable: Droid and Human. You can provide two arguments to facet_wrap(): ~, followed by the grouping variable nrow: the number of rows in which panels should be placed human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.25, color = &quot;black&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(title = &quot;Mass vs. height of humans and droids in Star Wars&quot;, x = &quot;Height (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Weight (kg)&quot;) + facet_wrap(~species, nrow=2) # using ~grouping_variable and nrow = 2 shows the two panels on top of each other Great, finally we can distinguish the data points representing humans from those representing droids! On the left side, however, the panel with the humans looks a bit empty. Maybe we should put them next to each other. human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year)) + geom_point(shape = 21, fill = &quot;black&quot;, alpha = 0.25, color = &quot;black&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(title = &quot;Mass vs. height of humans and droids in Star Wars&quot;, x = &quot;Height (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Weight (kg)&quot;) + facet_wrap(~species) # nrow=1 is the default, so you don´t have to call it explicitly I like that! 5.4.8 Saving graphs I think it’s time that we save this plot. To finish of this “masterpiece” (and make it less triste), let’s add some final colors before saving. We’ll fill our bubbles with colorful ink based on the species variable, so we need to add fill=species to the aes() and remove the default black ink provided in the geom_point() function. human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year, fill=species)) + geom_point(shape = 21, alpha = 0.25, color = &quot;black&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(title = &quot;Mass vs. height of humans and droids in Star Wars&quot;, x = &quot;Height (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Weight (kg)&quot;) + facet_wrap(~species) Congratulations! You have just managed to recreate the plot from the beginning of this tutorial! The only thing we haven’t covered yet is the labeling of all data points, because for that you’d need the ggrepel package to not mess up the labels - and that’s not part of ggplot2. So let’s skip that and save our graph. To use your graph in another document, e.g. a theses written in Word, you’ll have to export the plot first. Therefore, you must assign your plot to a new object and call the ggsave() function on that object. The plot will be saved to your working directory and formatted according to the file extension you specified (for example: .jpeg or .png). plot &lt;- human_droid_data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size=birth_year, fill=species)) + geom_point(shape = 21, alpha = 0.25, color = &quot;black&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(30, 140)) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(90, 210)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200)) + scale_size(range = c(1, 11), name = &quot;age&quot;) + theme_bw() + labs(title = &quot;Mass vs. height of humans and droids in Star Wars&quot;, x = &quot;Height (cm)&quot;, y = &quot;Weight (kg)&quot;) + facet_wrap(~species) ggsave(filename = &quot;mass_vs_height.jpeg&quot;, plot) "],["solutions.html", "Solutions Solutions for Exercise 1 Solutions for Exercise 2", " Solutions This is where you’ll find solutions for all of the tutorials.

How do you create a vector in R with elements 1, 2, 3? Solution: c(1,2,3) (x) 4. Imagine you have a vector called ‘vector’ with 10 numeric elements. How do you retrieve the 8th element? Solution: vector[8] (x) 5. Imagine you have a vector called ‘hair’ with 5 elements: brown, black, red, blond, other. How do you retrieve the color ‘blond’? Solution: hair[4] (x) Task 2 Create a numeric vector with 8 values and assign the name age to the vector. First, display all elements of the vector. Then print only the 5th element. After that, display all elements except the 5th. Finally, display the elements at the positions 6 to 8. Solution: age &lt;- c(65,52,73,71,80,62,68,87) age ## [1] 65 52 73 71 80 62 68 87 age[5] ## [1] 80 age[-5] ## [1] 65 52 73 71 62 68 87 age[6:8] ## [1] 62 68 87 Task 3 Create a non-numeric, i.e. character, vector with 4 elements and assign the name eye_color to the vector. First, print all elements of this vector to the console. Then have only the value in the 2nd element displayed, then all values except the 2nd element. At the end, display the elements at the positions 2 to 4.
